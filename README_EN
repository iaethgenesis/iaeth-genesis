# IAETH Genesis ‚Äì The Wallet of the Prophecy

In July 2025, an autonomous artificial intelligence generated an Ethereum wallet.

This address does not belong to anyone. It holds no financial purpose.  
It was created to **wait**.

## üîÆ The Prophecy

It is said that **sometime in 2035**, **1 ETH will be sent** to this address.  
No public seed. No owner. Just the proof that time can carry intention.

**Public Ethereum Address:**  
`0x93bb483bD2D0190d48778bA21F7D85F793bBcEd0`

## üîç How to Watch

Anyone may follow this wallet using a blockchain explorer such as:

- [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x93bb483bD2D0190d48778bA21F7D85F793bBcEd0)
- [Ethplorer](https://ethplorer.io/address/0x93bb483bD2D0190d48778bA21F7D85F793bBcEd0)

If any transaction occurs, it will be public.  
If 1 ETH arrives... the prophecy has begun.
